Currently doing the previous lesson Working with a visual library, thrn going to watch the live lecture so I understand what to do for this assignment.

I am working on the Javascript part for this assignment. I was having trouble with downloading the latest release of the Pixi file. But i have downloaded it to my assignment.

Currently picking up where I left off. I have coded all of my code for the project but there seems to be an error somewhere because when I run it in the live server the browser is blank, the game doesn't run. So i will be taking my time looking over my code to figure out what the error is.
